# 1HrAwsCrafts — Build AWS Skills by Shipping

A lightweight, hands-on learning series for AWS. Every 3 days, we ship a tiny, focused project you can complete in about an hour. Projects are Free Tier–friendly by default, follow least‑privilege IAM, and include explicit cleanup so costs stay near zero.

## Available Projects & READMEs
- Static website/ — Project 1 (S3-ready)
  - README: `Static website/README.md`

## How It Works
- Cadence: new project every 3 days
- Scope: single mini-project per cycle with clear start/end and easy teardown
- Documentation: every project folder ships with its own `README.md` describing:
  - Prerequisites
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Cleanup to avoid charges

## Project Folders & READMEs
Only available projects are listed above. Each project folder contains its own README with prerequisites, steps, and cleanup guidance.

## Quick Start (Local)
- Open `Static website/index.html` in your browser — no build step needed.

 

## Principles
- Small scope: finish in about an hour
- Predictable rhythm: ship every 3 days
- Free Tier focus: keep costs near zero; clean up promptly
- Safety: least-privilege IAM; avoid secrets; mindful public access

## Contributing
- Open issues or PRs with a clear description
- Keep styles minimal and consistent with `Static website/css/styles.css`
- Use relative paths so the site remains portable
